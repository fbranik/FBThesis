## Performance Analysis and Modeling of Parallel Applications in Distributed Memory Architectures

#### Authored by Fotis Branikas

### Thesis Abstract
High Performance Computing (HPC) is an area of computer science, that provides solutions to a lot of problems present in
contemporary sciences and engineering. Time on HPC systems is often a costly resource. For this reason, to maximize the
usage of such systems, engineers and parallel software developers, analyze and seek optimizations in architectures and
parallel programs. For the same reason, the compilation of predictive performance models is also of great benefit. Such
models can provide insights that are useful for making various choices, without the costs that come with actually
executing a program.

This thesis presents an in-depth performance analysis of a family of parallel applications for a distributed memory
architecture (a computer cluster), as well as an attempt at the compilation of a predictive performance model. The
latter is quite a complex
procedure that requires a deep understanding of the phenomena that may occur during the execution of a parallel program,
which is why it was accompanied by the formerly mentioned analysis. Î¤he compilation of a highly accurate model can be a
great and highly useful achievement, however for an HPC engineer, the journey required for this goal is itself of great
importance.
